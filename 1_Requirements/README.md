+ 100ohm Resistor We got the color code of resistor with respect to the decimal value of the respective band taken from left to right. So for 100-ohm resistor, 1st digit is ‘ 1 ‘, ∴ look for color in chart having value 1, then it’s your 1st color(say brown). The next 2nd digit is ‘ 0 ‘, ∴ look for color in chart having value 0, then it’s your 2nd color (say black). Next 3rd digit ‘0’ (but value 10^1 = 10) is multiplier ‘ 1 ‘, ∴ look for color in chart having value 1, then it’s your 3rd color (say brown).

+ Switch (Acting as door) An electrical switch is any device used to interrupt the flow of electrons in a circuit. Switches are essentially binary devices: they are either completely on (“closed”) or completely off (“open”).

+ Bulb A rounded underground storage organ present in some plants, notably those of the lily family, consisting of a short stem surrounded by fleshy scale leaves or leaf bases, lying dormant over winter

+ Voltmeter Voltmeter which is also known as voltage meter is an instrument that measures the voltage or potential difference among two points of an electronic or electrical circuit. Usually, the voltmeter is used for Alternating Current (AC) circuits or Direct Current (DC) circuits. Alternatively, Radio Frequency (RF) voltage can also be measured by specialized voltmeters.

## Advantages

+ It helps in securing home from theft Its will be cheaper can be installed in every room so as anyone enter the light turns on automatically it can be replaced with siren saves electricity.

## Disadavntages 

+ It can be irritating as light turns on everytime in night when someone enter except theif.
