+ 100ohm Resistor We got the color code of resistor with respect to the decimal value of the respective band taken from left to right. So for 100-ohm resistor, 1st digit is ‘ 1 ‘, ∴ look for color in chart having value 1, then it’s your 1st color(say brown). The next 2nd digit is ‘ 0 ‘, ∴ look for color in chart having value 0, then it’s your 2nd color (say black). Next 3rd digit ‘0’ (but value 10^1 = 10) is multiplier ‘ 1 ‘, ∴ look for color in chart having value 1, then it’s your 3rd color (say brown).
